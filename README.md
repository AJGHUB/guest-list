## CRUD-sublime
REACT Hooks CRUD 
A simple CRUD app. With users, the users can add, update, or delete users. This build utilizes React hooks and the Context API, to build a fully functional CRUD application. Tailwind CSS is used for the styling of this app, and Create React App sets up the project.

Purpose and learning of this build: This build is not using any external API calls but uses hard-coded objects which will serve as the state. The introduction of the Context API solves one major problem: 'prop drilling'. The process of getting our data from one component to another through layers of nested deep components. Whereas Hooks helps us, React developers, by allowing us to use a functional rather than class-based components. Where we needed to utilize a lifecycle method, we had to use a class-based approach. And we now no longer have to call super(props) or worry about binding methods or the this keyword. The core implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function. source-credit https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-crud-context-hooks
